# ADMIN DASHBOARD

[See the page](https://admin-dashboard-lime.vercel.app/)

* I designed an admin control panel.
* I used Firebase Realtime Database feature to store the data and Firebase Authentication feature for authentication operations.
* I used React Router Dom for page routing.
* Only Admin can login and add,update and delete employee datas.
* Sing in datas are written as placeholders. You can use them to sign in.
